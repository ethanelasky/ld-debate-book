#### **Organization**

*Why is organization important?*

The next thing that I want to talk about is organization. Watching the best debaters in the world, it can be easy to forget that their speeches are, in fact, meticulously ordered. Their speeches flow so smoothly that you almost forget that there’s a skeleton behind each one holding it sturdy. When you watch less skilled debaters, though, it becomes obvious that these skeletons are something they lack. Everyone knows the feeling of listening to a debater who clearly lacks a plan. It’s not a pleasant one.

*What are the different things that debaters need to organize?*

Debaters organize things through flows, speeches, and preparation. I’ll first go over flow organization, then I’ll discuss speech organization. Prep organization will be dealt with in the Research chapter.

*How are flows organized?*

I will start from the basics here in terms of organization, especially since as a beginner debater (for an embarrassingly long period of time) I didn’t truly know how to flow. Nobody taught me how, so it took me a bit to learn how to do it well. 

One general rule to flowing is that each new position (advantage/solvency, topicality/theory shell, kritik/critique, disadvantage, counterplan) should get a new piece of paper (either in excel or on physical paper. My flow template can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvash4fo4ukntjb/flow%20template%20%282%29.xlsm?dl=0)). You should orient your flow vertically and create a column for each speech. Within each speech, flow a summary of each argument tag (the bolded text above the actual card text). If you have time, flow card warrants and/or author qualifications. It’s often not possible to do so in high-speed debate rounds. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYIkBG1htEc) for a quick primer.

Remember to always flow in the order that arguments are spoken in. Judges get confused when your responses are out of order (unless you specifically point this out), and they often look at the original argument  made to interpret your response (which should be to the immediate right of the original argument on everyone’s flow). If the judge looks at the wrong argument, they might not understand your answer to it/or where it belongs, so it’s your job to prevent this. When flowing, it’s fine to read your opponent’s document as they’re verbalizing it[^5], but don’t be a slave to your computer. You should practice flowing without having a document to reference, as many people may omit analytics from the speech document[^6], extemporaneously give  arguments that aren’t on the document, and/or skip cards without mentioning that they’re skipping them. It’s on you to know what they skipped and didn’t[^7]. Be sure to follow the audio in real time to catch these shenanigans.

One common question that comes up is whether it’s important to precisely line up arguments and their responses across columns. I personally do it when it’s convenient and don’t when it’s inconvenient, but some people are firm believers in one or the other. The important thing is to know which arguments responses are aimed at.

Ways to improve flow organization:

* Practice a lot – start by watching and flowing high school LD rounds (the Premier Debate, Victory Briefs, and DebateDrills YouTube channels are all great places to start), then go to college policy (debatevid.io). If you can flow college policy, then you’re set for anything.

* Flow analysis – look for places where you’re writing too much and/or not using enough abbreviations. You can have a coach/friend give you feedback on your flow. It’s also important to make sure that you’re writing down claims of arguments first. It’s usually easy to get the gist of the warrant from a claim, especially after you’ve heard it multiple times. However, flowing warrants without keeping track of claims can lead you and your judge confused about what you’re responding to. 

* Do real debates—although YouTube is a great resource, it’s sometimes good to take away the luxury of the pause button. Practicing flowing under pressure is important to nailing it.

* Figure out a balance between listening/reading/flowing – sometimes the best way to stay organized is to not flow and just read. In my career, there were many times where I didn’t understand my opponent’s argument, so rather than waste time trying to summarize something I didn’t even grasp, I just sat there, read along, and listened to them. Later, I made a quick backflow of their main arguments and came up with responses.

* Watch some good flowers – one example I can think of is the recording of Harvard HS vs Michigan State MS in the 2016 NDT Semifinals. Also, Northwestern MO vs Harvard HS. The recordings show the judges flowing the debaters, so you can see how different people flow. Again, there isn’t one right way to do it. The important thing is just that you’re organized and that your flow sets you up to speak well.

*How are speeches organized?*

Another important facet of organization regards speeches.

First, let’s discuss transitions. Transitions signal to the judge to stop flowing one argument/position and move on to the next. Recall my earlier discussion of how judges try to line up arguments and responses on their flow. If a judge can’t obviously tell when you’re moving on to the next argument, then you’re committing an unforced error. You’re making the judge separate your arguments rather than doing it yourself. Forcing judges to do work for you often doesn’t have the best consequences (the scattershot, purely line-by-line 2NR discussed earlier is a perfect example of this). 

Judges may also think that you’re dropping arguments if they’re unable to line your arguments up with your opponent’s. This is a really bad look. Dropped arguments are often what judges cling to like a lifeline in a tough debate—it lets them avoid resolving clash and thus avoid the risk of resolving it wrong. Therefore, to look like you never drop arguments can help you gain charisma and the presumption that you’re more competent than your opponent. [^8]

Now let’s talk about examples of organization that make transitions obvious. 

The clearest one is numbering your arguments. Not only does it help judges distinguish when one argument ends and the next one begins, but it also gives them a mental map of which responses line up with which arguments. In other words, it makes arguments very discrete. Judges don’t have a Neuralink into your brain, which means it’s important to give them some predictable structure to fit the content of your speech into. 

Another great way to transition is to pause for a little bit when switching pages/sheets/positions (all the same thing, by the way). That way you’re giving the judge “pen time” (to be clear, most judges flow on computers nowadays, but that doesn’t mean they don’t need time to click on the next sheet [especially since many judges don’t use macro-enabled flow templates which means they don’t have any nifty shortcuts like the flow template I attached above]). While the previous section was primarily focused on your flow, this one focuses on the judge’s flow. Take it as self-evident that you must help the judge make their flow as good as can be. That also can include organizing your opponent’s arguments for them. 

*How can you organize your opponent’s arguments?*

Believe it or not, you can organize your opponent’s arguments on your judge’s flow. This leads to a valuable aside.

As a debater, you hold a lot more power than you think you do. Often, judges want permission to do something (e.g. scratching blippy arguments off the flow). However, most won’t unless instructed to do so. If you’ve ever judged a debate, you’ve felt that pressure—you’ve probably had questions in your head like, were those arguments a bit too blippy? Did I actually get every argument they made? Did I miss one? And so on. Judges will probably have an intuition that this is bad, but as a non-interventionist observer, they have a bias towards inaction. Your job here is to confirm the judge’s intuition, which might sound something like this:

“Group the next four arguments—every argument has to pass the claim, a warrant, and an impact test – these arguments each only have one of those three so you should strike them off the flow because they’re incomplete – anything else encourages blippy debates that avoid educational clash”

Obviously some judges wouldn’t bite, but you have a pref sheet for a reason.

*Where should high-level transitions occur?*

You can see great transitioning in any high-level college policy debate. You’ll notice that transitions between individual arguments are very strong (if a bit quick for high school LD). Later rebuttals have more pronounced transitions so try to emulate those in your rebuttals. [This debate](https://youtu.be/cl4fkdfJ2sI) between Georgetown KL and Harvard MS at the 2017 National Debate Tournament for college policy is a phenomenal example of both. 

One last form of speech organization is a macro level organization that is only needed when you’re deviating from a script (e.g. when you read a large dump of case answers, which you need to organize, or whenever you’re giving a rebuttal). It’s basically like a mid-speech check-in that helps the judge understand what you’re doing. For example, in a debate versus a non-topical aff that makes a claim about structural pessimism (e.g. Afropessimism), say you read topicality and the Cap K. Let’s say the 1AR makes it so the obvious 2NR is topicality. You should still spend a bit of time to answer the aff in this scenario. One subtle but strategic thing might be to extend a link from the Cap K, not as an external impact, but as a case answer. The judge would probably be confused if you went to the Cap K after T and just started extending a link without any explanation, but if you prefaced it by saying that you were extending a Cap K link as a takeout to case (and explained why whatever answers they made on the K didn’t interact with/prove your argument), then the judge would be much more receptive of your link extension. 

To understand why judges need you to process information for them, let’s use starting a new book as an example. Often books begin with a prologue which helps develop the context of the story without contributing directly to the main plot line. I’ll call this piece of information indigestible – the judge can’t process it and fit it into a narrative because they don’t know the actual story yet. This prologue approach is often successful in foreshadowing future plot points of the main story line. However, when left undigested for too long, these pieces of information may make the reader frustrated or confused. then the reader may become confused. This is essentially what happens when giving a debate speech. Judges are constantly trying to put together an argumentative narrative and look to you to give them digestible pieces of content. If you give them too many unconnected pieces of information, which are essentially undigestible, they may just give up, give you low speaks, or not give you the benefit of the doubt.

Additionally, different judges require different forms of packaging. The more your judge understands the vocabulary and theory of your argument’s domain, the more complexly you can package it. Connecting the dots is essential for judges who have less domain knowledge. For example, implicating your “extinction first” arguments when debating a small-impact aff will be different depending on whether your judge is a parent judge or someone with experience in policy.

To sum up, you should try to clue the judge into whatever you’re doing. Transitions are the best single way to help them organize their flows and create mental models of your strategy. It’s in your best interest to become exceptional at transitioning very early on because it’s important in every debate. Other forms of packaging are also necessary to make your arguments digestible.

[^5]:  This is also useful for catching clipping. Some judges will read along, especially to catch clipping, but many judges will not, especially in rebuttal speeches.
[^6]:  i.e., card-less arguments.
[^7]:  You can use some CX or prep time on this, but if you ask too many questions (assuming your opponent was clear), your judge might doubt your competence.
