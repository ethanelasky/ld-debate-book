### **Part 0: The Ground Rules**

*What does Lincoln-Douglas debate look like?*

In this part, I will briefly discuss what a round of debate looks like. A more nuanced view is contained in the following chapters.

Lincoln-Douglas debate is a format of one-on-one debate over a resolution that is switched seasonally. The **affirmative** side (**AFF**) is assigned to defend an advocacy within the bounds of the resolution, and the **negative** side (NEG) exists to disprove that advocacy. Resolutions ask questions of desirability. Some past resolutions are listed below ([link here](https://www.speechanddebate.org/topics/)): 

- Resolved: Nations ought to eliminate their nuclear arsenals.  
- Resolved: The member nations of the World Trade Organization ought to reduce intellectual property protections for medicines.  
- Resolved: The appropriation of outer space by private entities is unjust.

The resolution exists to limit what the affirmative can advocate for. It’s the only thing published in advance of a debate tournament. Without a resolution, affirmatives could pick the easiest thing to advocate for, and negatives would not know what to prepare. Barring some exceptions, the **affirmative** (**AFF**) debater wins by defending that their advocacy is desirable. Similarly, the **negative** (**NEG**) wins by proving that the AFF advocacy is undesirable. 

The speech times are as follows (including cross-examinations):

- First Affirmative Constructive (1AC): 6 minutes
- Negative CX of the 1AC: 3 minutes
- First Negative Constructive (1NC): 7 minutes
- Affirmative CX of the 1NC: 3 minutes
- First Affirmative Rebuttal (1AR): 4 minutes
- Negative Rebuttal (NR): 6 minutes*
- Second Affirmative Rebuttal (2AR): 3 minutes

\*The negative rebuttal is often called the 2NR, 2NC, or the 1NR, taking after policy debate. As will be made obvious over the course of this book, Lincoln-Douglas has been heavily influenced by policy debate over the last 15 years.

As seen above, there are two types of speeches: constructive and rebuttal.

Constructive speeches let both sides introduce lots of evidence into the debate by reading cards. Cards are pieces of evidence which have been selectively underlined and/or highlighted for efficiency; in a debate speech, only highlighted text (and a card’s accompanying label, called a tag) is read aloud.

Rebuttal speeches let debaters selectively develop their previous arguments and resolve clash in favor of their perspective.
