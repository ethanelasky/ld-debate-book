#### **Charisma**

*What is perceptual dominance?*

Debaters often use the words “perceptual dominance” to mean good form in debate. I don’t like the words perceptual dominance because I think they sound Freudian. Instead, I’ll call this skill charisma. 

I want you to imagine some speakers who embody charisma. Some that come to me include Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, and Dwarkesh Patel. Try to imagine what *makes* them charismatic. Is it their posture? Is it their speech patterns? Is it their body language?

The answer is that charismatic people all share a few qualities. Their speech and movement are controlled. They don’t stumble or stutter. They are calm. Their words take up weight. Their pauses are just as intentional as their words. It’s comfortable confidence that they embody. 

Since these qualities are inherent to speech, they obviously factor into debate. Charismatic debaters are comfortable with what they do, and the judge can see that too. They’re not afraid to defend their position and take advantage of the holes in others’ positions. You can also call this trait having a personality, or alternative, not being a nervous wreck/a robot.

You can see charisma in action by watching Will Morgan, formerly of the Michigan college policy team. Even though he’s spewing nonsense in [this 1AC cross-examination](https://youtu.be/npEtCApMh0k), Will Morgan clearly exudes a lot of charisma. Despite Michigan State’s Tyler Thur asking intuitive questions, it’s hard to not like Morgan here.

*How exactly does charisma make it into RFDs?*

You might be wondering how charisma figures into a judge’s reason for decision (RFD). Many newer debaters assume that flow judges are completely unlike traditional judges. This common yet naïve assumption is that traditional judges vote on pathos, and flow judges vote on logic.[^1]

The reality is that charisma is a filter for performance. If a judge thinks that you’re winning, they will likely frame the debate in their head from your side. This judge will start with the presumption that you won, trying to use logic and argumentation to justify this decision. Unlike our Econ 101 model of rational people, who go from evidence to conclusion, most people in the real world go from conclusion to evidence. “Rational people” is an oxymoron. Better to give the judge the conclusion to start with and let them find pieces that support it.[^2]

Charisma is difficult to improve at, as it’s a skill that everyone has been practicing their whole lives. Here are some suggestions:

* Read a book on an activity where charisma is more centrally important, like improv comedy: I recommend the first chapter of *Impro*, by Keith Johnstone. Other people have recommended Dale Carnegie’s *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, but this book’s diction made me put it down.[^3]

* Give the same speech but with different demeanors. Consider playing a military commander, a wall flower, a friendly nerd, a jock, etc. Or perhaps try doing this in life (note: doing it with the same people doesn’t work, unless it’s part of something like improv comedy). Part of finding your “voice” is realizing that the one you use for daily life is not the only one you are capable of. Wearing different personas can help you gain perspective on what your current persona may be lacking and can provide you easy material to incorporate.

* Start examining how people’s personalities influence how they interact with others. You can find good examples in books, movies, and TV (also, it’s good to understand how their actions/reactions demonstrate their personalities/feelings). The important thing here is that you start thinking about and start recognizing socially desirable and undesirable behavior within others, so you can start to understand it within yourself.

* Get a customer-facing job that allows you to experiment with your demeanor. People will react totally differently to you if your voice is cracking, your shoulders are shrugged, or your head is down compared to if your voice is smooth, your shoulders are relaxed, and your head is up (while making good eye contact). Or, you can talk to service workers and new people at parties. The key is lots and lots of trial and error.

* Get friends you can joke around with—be able to make fun of your friends in non-hurtful ways (as well as being able to take a joke yourself). Being able to make/take a joke well is a sure sign of confidence since it shows others that you’re funny and not anxious/defensive. Being humorous is also the key to acknowledging many weird situations, creating camaraderie between you and the judge/showing them that you’re not a robot/showing them that you’re able to think on your feet. And it’s a great way to boost your speaks in-round.

* Do lots of debates—you’ll get better at being confident the more you practice debating so just by doing it a lot you’ll get pretty decent at it. 

* Go to therapy—a lot of people have ingrained developmental trauma that causes them to shut down or get defensive whenever they experience conflict. Debate is inherently about conflict, so you should get the help you need if you see your persona in a debate round as inferior to your persona in real life. A book I can recommend here is *Already Free* by Bruce Tift—it’s not a substitute for therapy, but it can help you understand why you have certain behavioral patterns and can get you thinking about how to acknowledge/work on those parts of yourself. 

* Drills—the most important drills on this topic focus on style and delivery, not so much content. You should be able to say nonsense while maintaining the same level of charisma. CX is doubly relevant since it’s the only time in a debate where you’ll be having normal conversations with your opponents.

[^1]:  There is a type of debater who loses a round to a technically incompetent yet charismatic opponent while being judged by a parent. These types often believe that judge evaluation should start and end on the flow. “If only my judges were smarter, they claim.” These debaters tend to filter themselves out of traditional debate with the belief that their technical skills would be better suited to flow debating. This intuition isn’t wrong per se. In fact, this was my mentality when I was a freshman. They are correct that more emphasis is placed on logic in “flow” debate when compared with “lay” debate, but in the process they often erroneously write off charisma entirely.
[^2]:  There’s also a set-based explanation that explains why confident debaters are the best. The logic is that at a certain point, the people who succeeded due to sheer technical skill start to stagnate; that hill has more-or-less been climbed. There’s only so much someone can do to get faster/more word efficient, leaving improving confidence as the only way to get better.
[^3]:  There is a broader life lesson – to rapidly improve at a skill, you can join (or practice for) an activity that directly relies on that skill, in the process finding expert teachers who are more specialized at teaching that skill. There’s a reason why I took speech lessons to get better at charisma (and not debate).
