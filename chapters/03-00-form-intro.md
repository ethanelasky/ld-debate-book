### **Part 1: Form**

#### **Intro to Part 1**

*What is form?*

Form includes everything that is not the literal words in the debate. From physical appearance, body language, facial expressions to tone of voice and delivery, and everything that is not the literal words themselves.

*Why does form matter?*

Form is important. Judges aren’t perfectly logical computers. Obviously, they’re human. As much as some people would like it to be the case, 2NRs don’t often win by machine-gunning blips (short arguments) at their opponents. If judges were actually rational calculators, debaters would never have to make comparisons.  Judges wouldn’t need help resolving how likely, how big, and how soon your impacts will happen. Judges would already know how to decide and would be able to vote as soon as the 2AR ends. That is obviously not the world we live in. Even though many judges claim a somewhat mechanical paradigm of *tabula rasa* (blank slate), judges definitely want to feel connected with who they are evaluating. Perceptual dominance, organization, and argument resolution all tap into a judge’s desire to be persuaded. I’ll talk about these skills in that order.
