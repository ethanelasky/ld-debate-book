## Theory

Most games, like soccer and basketball, have rules. Those games’ refs exist to enforce them. When someone/something goes out of bounds, a penalty is enforced. Debate doesn’t quite work like this. Outside of the speech times, the whole activity is up for argument. There aren’t any rules stating that X number of conditional counterplans is unfair. Theory is the language of the rules over competing models of debate. 

Theory arguments parallel topicality in many ways. They use the same paradigm issues, appeal to the same voting issues (fairness and education), and both deal with competing models of debate.

There are two ways to structure theory arguments: the policy style and the traditional LD style.

The policy style, also called paragraph theory, presents theory just like other arguments. For instance, on a counterplan sheet, an aff might argue the following:

> Conditionality’s a voting issue:
>
> 1] Strat skew – splits the 1ar by forcing me to argue against multiple worlds with different uniqueness conditions which precludes taking advantage of strategic interactions and contradictions
>
> 2] Clash – incentivizes reading many short advocacies and going for the least covered which moots 1ar responses and prevents going in-depth on their position’s nuances. Outweighs because external education and multiple rounds solve their education impacts but clash only occurs in-round
>
> 3] Dispo solves—they can kick it if we perm—allows sufficient neg flexibility while preserving 1ar strategic decision-making

This is from [Santa Monica RE’s 2019 Stanford Round 2 speech document](https://hsld19.debatecoaches.org/download/Santa%20Monica/Evans%20Aff/Santa%20Monica-Evans-Aff-Stanford-Round2.docx). It was the condo block I read most of my senior year.

 This example doesn’t have a labeled interpretation, a violation, or voting issues. Reading this type of argument is best in front of judges who are either policy-minded or don’t have a strong preference since it is so much more efficient.

But in front of LD judges, the topicality-derived structure is necessary. You should ask the judge to flow your argument on a new sheet and follow the Interpretation, Violation, Standards, Voter style we discussed above. Your interpretation doesn’t need definitions because you’re arguing for a model of debate practice, not an interpretation of the topic wording.
