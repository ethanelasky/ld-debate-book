#### **Appendix 2: Why Debate Intuition Matters**

There are two different methods people use to understand complicated things. They are rationality and intuition. I’ll use language as an analogy. Adult language learners usually start with rational understandings (“The subject goes here,” “This language puts verbs at the end,” “The word for X is Y,” etc.). The issue is that this can only take them so far. Rational thought takes a lot of energy, which is why adult learners in other countries often complain about feeling exhausted after speaking a foreign language. Eventually, with enough practice, rational thought translates to intuition; this is when people start thinking in that language. “What a relief\!” they think. No longer do they have to consciously translate every thought from their original language to the new one. Instead, they just know how to speak. This is intuition. 

Debate concepts function in a similar way. Rational understandings usually come first for debaters, leading to intuitive understandings later. Only through practice and deep understanding can your mind shortcut rational processes. Good intuition can also help you adapt to unfamiliar situations that you haven’t thought through rationally yet (which is key in debate, when you have limited time to think).

One thing to highlight here is that getting good at debate takes a lot of practice. Nobody learns a language from classroom lectures, even if they were to go to lectures daily for four years straight. Many high school students do this and can’t speak a lick of their language. Similarly, only doing research and never giving practice speeches will ensure you “know” debate theoretically but not in practicality.

Next, I’ll develop another framework. This one is for evaluating debaters
