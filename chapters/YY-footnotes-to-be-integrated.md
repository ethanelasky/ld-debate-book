[^1]:  There is a type of debater who loses a round to a technically incompetent yet charismatic opponent while being judged by a parent. These types often believe that judge evaluation should start and end on the flow. “If only my judges were smarter, they claim.” These debaters tend to filter themselves out of traditional debate with the belief that their technical skills would be better suited to flow debating. This intuition isn’t wrong per se. In fact, this was my mentality when I was a freshman. They are correct that more emphasis is placed on logic in “flow” debate when compared with “lay” debate, but in the process they often erroneously write off charisma entirely.

[^2]:  There’s also a set-based explanation that explains why confident debaters are the best. The logic is that at a certain point, the people who succeeded due to sheer technical skill start to stagnate; that hill has more-or-less been climbed. There’s only so much someone can do to get faster/more word efficient, leaving improving confidence as the only way to get better.

[^3]:  There is a broader life lesson – to rapidly improve at a skill, you can join (or practice for) an activity that directly relies on that skill, in the process finding expert teachers who are more specialized at teaching that skill. There’s a reason why I took speech lessons to get better at charisma (and not debate).

[^7]:  You can use some CX or prep time on this, but if you ask too many questions (assuming your opponent was clear), your judge might doubt your competence.
