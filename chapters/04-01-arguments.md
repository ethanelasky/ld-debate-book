# Argument

## What is an argument?

What unifies all arguments is that they each have a claim, a warrant, and an implication. A claim is self-descriptive—it’s the 3–8-word phrase that summarizes your argument. Some examples are “No China war,” “McDonalds is bad,” “Climate change causes extinction,” etc. They lack explanatory power on their own, which is what warrants are for. 

A warrant answers the question inspired by the claim. For example, given the above claims, you might ask yourself: Why does China war not happen? Why is McDonalds bad? Why does climate change cause extinction? In other words, a warrant is a reason why a claim is considered true. Warrants are usually around 10-15 words long. For example, for the claim “No China war,” your warrant could be “trade relations guarantee peace because neither side wants to rupture codependent industries” (which is 12 words). 

Warrants should be self-containing. What I mean by this is that your warrants shouldn’t also need warrants. Otherwise, you’ll end up in a death spiral of over-explanation. This death spiral can look something like “No China war because trade relations constrain leaders on both sides since presidents are beholden to economic interests which are powerful due to lobbying blah blah blah.” Everyone has made arguments like these so it’s important to practice making good warrants. 

The last part of an argument is an implication. Sometimes the implication is obvious. For example, “no China war” implies that their impact is not true and thus that the disadvantage has a lower probability (which is essentially the claim). When the implication is obvious, I recommend omitting it in earlier speeches (1AC/1NC/1AR). 

Every argument has an implication. You have a reason behind everything you do in debate and the implication is just that. The reason to argue no China war, for example, is to reduce the probability of your opponent’s argument so that yours will seem comparatively more appealing. Conversely, if you don’t have a reason to make an argument, don’t make it. The reason to do this explanation is because the judge should always know what’s going on (which is justified in the previous chapter).

Debaters should pay special attention here. Not having concise warrants and not being able to explain implications are big inhibitors of progress. I personally had to work on them a lot. I naïvely assumed that because I was already winning rounds that I had these two fundamentals down, but it wasn’t until I started resolving this issue midway through my junior year that I began to see glimpses of success. This structure is essential, regardless of style.

Some ways to work on warranting:

- Come up with analytic answers to bad disads and give 1ARs on them. You shouldn’t use evidence to do this because the whole point of this exercise is to focus on quality and brevity of warrant. I suggest trying to get to 5 arguments in 30-45 seconds. It’s fine if these arguments are under-implicated because they’re obviously meant to take out the disad so it’s fine to sandbag the actual implication work until the 2AR. Use a new disad every time you do this drill (preferably one you haven’t seen before). That way you’ll get strong skills in quickly determining flaws in evidence/arguments which is useful when 1NCs break new positions against you. 

Some ways to work on warrants and implications in tandem:

- Redo speeches from college policy. Read my article on watching rounds \[here]() to do this well.

- Read long K/policy/philosophy articles and annotate them for claims, warrants, and potential implications. Then explain each card-length excerpt simply (3-5 sentences). This will force you to find what’s important in each argument so you can set your implications up well. And once you know the implication you’re going for, you can find the warrant that fits it. This is a good skill to practice because often long cards from college policy are hard to sum up and being good at doing that means you can find inspiration from the college wiki’s characteristically long cards.

- Write your papers in the claim-warrant-implication format. This is applicable beyond just debate. One thing I realized in writing English papers was that good warrants and implications are the name of the game. Teachers often welcome creative warrants for themes discussed in class. They also appreciate side implications that support the main points of your paper. 

The next thing I should talk about is different macro-arguments, or positions. These are made up of many individual arguments and follow the same format.
