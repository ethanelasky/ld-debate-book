### **Part 3: Research**

#### **Research**

Research is fundamental to debate. It’s what constitutes nearly all good constructive speeches and is elaborated on by the rebuttals. Good evidence wins and loses debates.

There are a few theoretical reasons why research is important.

 First, it’s one of the primary goals of debate. It gives you an opportunity to learn a lot about a topic and come out of the activity a more knowledgeable person. This reason doesn’t help you be more strategic, but it does help ground our understanding of why so many judges care about it so much. Most judges want to see good clash (which requires research). They also want to learn new things and hear fresh takes on familiar topic (which requires research). There’s no way around it. This also means research is a powerful in-road to an education-based theoretical argument, which will be explained later if you’re confused.

*How does research differ from school to school?*

I’ll talk now a bit about research as it exists in the debate community. It’s unfortunate that so many people attribute inequity in debate due to disparate research capacities between the lone wolves and, say, the Harvard-Westlakes of the world. Many people are somewhat—but not totally—accurate in this evaluation. However, it’s frustrating to think that people will hear these takes and just give up on doing good research. In this section, I’ll talk about how to maximize the value of the time you spend research. I’ll also show that the disparity between big and small schools is not about research as much as many think. 

Let’s discuss the benefits that big schools get in terms of research and how to counteract them as a small-school debater. 

Big schools often have more coaching resources, both in terms of number and in terms of dedication. Big schools are the only ones who can afford to pay people to coach debate full time, rather than relying primarily on students like most smaller teams do. That means that they can dedicate a lot more time and focus to making sure their students are prepared. Big schools usually have the advantage of having a lot of prep, and a lot of good prep at that, but smaller-school debaters can do some things to try to level the prep field. 

The number one best thing that small-school debaters can do is focus on quality over quantity. Ideally, each position that you research as a small-school debater should be generally applicable. In other words, it’s not smart to cut entire positions meant to beat one or two specific teams.

Many small-school debaters flock to the K for this reason. The whole point of the kritik is that it criticizes the notion that the aff is a unique deviation from the status quo, which in your case should be related to the topic. Some debaters choose to read totalizing critiques that don’t have a topic-specific link (i.e. pessimism), but I don’t think these are the most strategic to read if you also want to read some policy arguments. Not only do they have tension with most policy positions, but they also require a lot more dedication to get good at. People’s pessimism answers by this point are good since teams have been answering it for years, so it’s hard to get into that critique in my opinion. 

The better thing to do is to read critiques that take issue with all affs on a single topic. For example, I researched (but unfortunately never read due to judging constraints): a Cap K on the SAT topic that took issue with reforming education to resolve economic disparities; a Heidegger K on the fossil fuel emissions topic that took issue with the scientific management of climate science; and a Spanos K on the nuclear weapons topic that took issue with traditional conceptions of international relations. These critiques took issue with literally every single aff, meaning I could read them against any aff and I would have a negative strategy. There are [many](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2019/03/18/ks-on-the-arms-sales-topic/) [guides](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/topic-k-example-immigration/) [available](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2021/05/27/how-to-start-researching-a-water-topic-k/) on the HS Impact blog for finding topic critiques which I’ll leave to Scott Phillips to explain.

With a K, you can also just moot big schools’ advantage is to read arguments that make their prep irrelevant. This is most common with the K, where you can literally explain the 2NR as whatever wasn’t answered in their 1AR. (The reason “Not my Baudrillard” got turned into a meme was because it was initially said by a few great K debaters after all.)

People often don’t know how to explain their 1AR arguments in the context of your 2NR (if they even know how to explain them at all, which is also pretty uncommon), meaning that getting good at the 2NR on a critique is a good strategy. Some people/teams who debated like this include Ronak Ahuja (Chaminade/Futures/Halstrom RA), Kumail Zaidi (Oak Hall KZ), and Michigan KM. 

People also don’t usually update their blocks which means if you get a corner on the literature and know all the 1AR answers people will read, then you’re basically set since you can just write out or prep the entirety of your 2NR.

So I’ve talked about the strategy of research which is a bit of a copout I guess but it’s also important to know how you’re going to research when you actually start researching. Except research doesn’t work that way. At least initially, it doesn’t make sense to go into a topic knowing what you’re looking for. It’s better to be modest and figure out which lemons the topic is giving you rather than trying to materialize some out of thin air. So, let’s get into learning how to actually do research.

The best way to research initially, no matter what the topic is and no matter how you approach the topic, is to just start reading about it. Scotty gives a brief primer [here](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/the-inverted-pyramid-of-research/) on how to get started with a topic. [This article](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/underappreciated-research-practices-part-i/), also by Scotty, is a primer containing some additional useful information. 

To sum up the previous point, the first and most important thing is a general understanding of your topic. To repeat Scotty, the best places to start are books and primers summarizing the topic. Usually, books have introductory chapters that describes the history of the topic as well as solution chapters that give different takes on the topic. Intro chapters are good for cutting topicality definitions and counterplan competition arguments. They often try to define a topic, discuss what is useful and not useful to talk about, and make claims about the state of research. The later chapters usually also have decent cards. You can usually use these cards for link/uniqueness/solvency evidence. However, you’ll have to get your impact evidence elsewhere, since impacts are generic from topic to topic and usually have their own literature bases. You also should try not to get bogged down while reading lots of seemingly useless knowledge that doesn’t have much practical application. Research is a process of trial and error, which means it’s hard to know what might be useful when first starting out. You should just skim at first and cut cards that might be useful later. 

Other books offer critical takes on a topic—these are harder to come by directly but are usually gold mines for critique link evidence. The key websites to use here are Google and Google Scholar. You can sometimes find pdfs of books on Google Books. 

The next thing to look for are articles offering different takes on the topic. These articles should be similar to the book chapters that you read earlier, except they’re standalone on Google Scholar. After finding a bunch of articles and then putting aside the least relevant/interesting titles, Scotty recommends the following:

> 4. Read- ok so now you want to read about 10 articles to start. These articles should be broad, and since you were selective they should all be high quality. Reading them will give you a solid basis for understanding the issue you are researching and will help you get a handle on what kind of arguments you will want to make (your side) and what you will have to answer (the other side).

Scotty here is right not to cut cards first. Also, you don’t want to have to re-find an article a second time just to find what you could’ve noted the first time. So on top of what Scotty says here, I recommend making a card file containing interesting or potentially card-worthy passages. I’d use tags to quickly describe these as well. That way if you need that passage, you can go back and highlight it.

If you find a good article, you should also investigate some things related to it, namely the footnote references, the works it cites, the articles that cite it, and other articles by the author, which all might have relevant articles that you might not have found otherwise. 

Once you find some link/internal link evidence that you think is useful, you can start investigating to find a terminal impact to your internal links. 

After doing your initial research, don’t be afraid to look for a past high school or college policy topic that is similar to your topic. Even though the research may be out of date, there might be some arguments that you missed in your initial search. You can often find authors who write about the things that you’re looking for, as well as updated versions of articles that past teams have cited. Probably the best way to figure out whose wikis to look at is to look at that year’s NDT results on Tabroom and look at the most successful debaters’ pages. For instance, DebateDrills on the military aid topic took the demining counterplan from the college policy topic on military presence and deployed it to great success in that year’s season. As a general rule though, you should strive to recut and update all arguments you don’t cut yourself. Judges can usually smell when you’ve been stealing cards without putting in extra effort. Recutting and re-highlighting will also give you good sources to further research the topic from and will help you make cards short enough for LD. 

*How is topicality research different than regular policy/K research?*

The next type of research I’ll talk about is topicality research which requires additional methods for success. I talked before about how introductory chapters in topic books usually have good cards, but you usually need something more. Good topicality cards are ones that define terms in the resolution, talk about what the topic “is” about or should be about, give case-lists, or attack counterdefinitions/counter-conceptions of the topic. There are three main resources for researching T: Google, Google Scholar Articles, and Google Scholar Case Law. The first two will give you academic articles on the topic, while the Case Law page will give you court decisions. Since case law usually only defines legal topics, if you try to look up something like “lethal autonomous weapons” you might not get any results. But I cut all of our “eliminate” definitions for both NovDec and JanFeb for my senior year off Google Case Law and we did well with them. 

There are some topicality search terms that are pretty useful.

Scotty lists some [here:](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2020/03/17/topicality-cjr-1/) (bullets mine)

* The phrase X

* The term X

* The meaning of X

* X is defined as

* When defining X

I’ll add a few more:

*The word X

*The definition of X

* When categorizing X

*X means

You can combine these in some long Google search like 

`“the term eliminate” OR “the meaning of eliminate” OR “the word eliminate” OR “the definition of eliminate”` 

and so on and so forth.

It’s important to cut definitions for every single word in the topic. Not only will these definitions be useful for T-Defend the Topic, but they’ll also be essential for when teams read weird topicality arguments against you and you need counterdefinitions to defend your aff. These definitions are easily transferrable to counterplan competition as AFF/NEG perm evidence as well.

So now that I’ve talked about policy, topicality, and K research, I’ll briefly touch on philosophy research. Philosophy research isn’t that predictable on most topics—you’ll come across it randomly when authors start citing people like Kant, Aristotle, etc. You can brute force the research by doing Google searches for the cards you’re looking for, but doing this has low returns. The real difficulty is finding philosophy frameworks that support one side or another on a topic. It usually takes a philosophy major coach who just intuitively can see the topic in relation to different ideologies and can direct you to which ones most strongly affirm or negate. 

“Good research” in a policy sense doesn’t apply as much for philosophy. Strong philosophy contention-level arguments are not based in empirics/reality as it is. They have more to do with validating intentions and ideals. If your argument requires you to have stellar descriptive evidence then you’re doing it wrong. 

*What is evidence ethics?*

One last thing to note under the research section is evidence ethics.

Evidence ethics is a topic I feel more strongly about than much of the debate community. I’ll explain my view here. I’ll point out some things that are good and some things that are bad.

Good:

* Evidence starts with the beginning of a paragraph and ends with the end of a paragraph.

* Author qualifications are represented accurately and reflect credentials AT TIME OF PUBLICATION.

* Dates are accurate.

* The original passage is preserved in its entirety. There are no omitted paragraphs or ellipses.

Bad

* Evidence is cut from the middle of a paragraph.

* A strawman piece of evidence is read without indication that it’s a strawman (this means reading a piece of evidence that argues a position then ultimately disagrees with it. People almost always leave off the part where the author disagrees with the initial premise).

* Author qualifications are misrepresented [e.g. here](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/psa-hunkovic-taiwan-impact/).

* Selective highlighting – making the card say something that it doesn’t actually say.

* i.e. minimizing important words like “could, may, might.” It’s fine to not read these but make sure they’re bolded, underlined, or at least a normal font size (not font size 1) so people can point this out.

All of these should be fairly obvious and intuitive. It’s not that hard to cut ethical cards, so just follow the rules and you’ll be on your way to success.

Scotty wrote [this article](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2019/01/14/new-years-debate-resolutions-1-evidence-quality/) for a quick guide on how to cite evidence well. Alternatively, you can look at one of the top college teams’ wikis and copy how they do their cites. Alternatively, you can listen to [this podcast](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2020/10/23/hsi-podcast-128-yes-alternative-plus-bonus/) starting at 1:09:03, in which Scotty walks through some examples of cutting evidence. 

Lastly, a lot of people wonder about how to get access to articles and books behind paywalls. I have to tell you not to use Sci-hub and Library Genesis, which are free websites that can give you .pdf and .epub files. If these sites were legal, they would be very useful, which is proven by the fact that a lot of the community already use them, but I must mention that it is illegal, so I can’t condone its usage.
