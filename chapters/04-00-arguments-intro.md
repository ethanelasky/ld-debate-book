# Part 2: Argument

This is the spot where the how-to manual for absolute beginners might start if the manual was written in the Enlightenment era—from the ground up. However, since this is 2021, I figured I should give you some understanding of supposedly “irrational” judgments before we moved to rational argument.

Here, I’ll walk you through the basics of the micro-level of debate. We’ll start from the argument, the most fundamental part of debate. We’ll then cover how macro-arguments, or positions, are structured. Then, we’ll go over examples of different types of positions.
