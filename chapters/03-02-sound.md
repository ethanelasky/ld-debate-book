#### **Sound**

*How does the way you sound factor into the way people perceive you?*

When you first saw national circuit-level debate, you probably thought that their style of speaking was incomprehensible. Then, you got used to listening to people speed read (spread), but you probably thought it still didn’t sound great. After a while, you probably got used to it. Double-breathing and yelling became normal to you. While it’s good that you’ve become accustomed to spreading, we should be able to agree that neither double-breathing nor yelling sound great. The only reason why people continue to do them is because they see skilled debaters online do them and they [mimic them](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm). Don’t do this.

Not only do these practices sound bad, but they will also affect your debating. 

If you scream/yell/shout your words, your voice will become prematurely hoarse. Destroying your voice in the preliminary rounds is not a good recipe for elimination round success. Screams also strain the ear, which makes it harder for your judge to understand you.

Double-breathing is just a form of stumbling. It creates unnecessary interruptions in your words when a single breath would do. This leads to less fluid and understandable sentences. Research suggests that less controlled breathing also makes you more nervous. [^4]

You should sound like a normal person when you’re spreading, except your words should come out much more quickly. It may be difficult to start speaking like a normal person on 3x speed after training yourself to sound like a “debater,” but you’ll get it quickly if you practice it. You can see Scotty explain this [here](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2016/03/16/do-you-want-to-be-top-speaker-at-the-toc-part-2-stop-cutting-cards-start-working-on-craft/) under the header “Questions about part 1.”

When you debate, you should be standing if able. When standing, reading material should be somewhere between the eye and the solar plexus and should be around one to two feet away from your body. In all cases, good posture is important. That way you’ll be able to breathe deeply with your diaphragm, rather than shallowly through your accessory chest muscles. You’ll take fewer total breaths, increasing your fluidity and your word count.

Some ways to improve your sound include:

* Incorporating the above feedback while doing speaking drills.   
* Scotty has a sample drill schedule and miscellaneous feedback on how to sound better [here](https://hsimpact.wordpress.com/2016/03/09/how-to-be-top-speaker-at-the-toc-part-1/).
