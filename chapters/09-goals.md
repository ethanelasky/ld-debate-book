#### **Goals**

Goals are important. Most people sit down to practice debate, but they don’t have a goal in mind. They don’t know if they’re going to go to the TOC, how they’re going to get there, when they’ll know if they’re going to get there, or how much work to put in to get what they want out of debate. This sets them up for failure—their goals’ haziness frustrates most attempts to track progress. They can’t quantify their effort since their everyday effort towards improvement seems miniscule. And the odds at getting a bid are not consistent—you might hit the \#1 debater in the country in your bid round and lose brutally. Or you might get walked over your novice teammate who broke and get it automatically. What I want to give you is a chart that you can measure yourself against to see where you’re at. This article won’t be perfect, but it’ll be a hell of a lot better than having absolutely nothing at all to measure yourself against. There will be a time where you outgrow the need for these metrics, but I assume that since you’re reading it you’ve already tried (or thought about trying) hard at debate and actually want to get serious at it. 

#### A quick rundown of different “levels” of improvement

**Level 1:** Novice

\* Still trying to understand debate jargon

\* Has difficulty understanding spreading

\* Missing most fundamental skills

\* Little rational understanding. Little intuitive understanding

**Level 2:** Finally 2-4 or 3-3 consistently

\* Can understand most spreading

\* Several fundamental skills are underdeveloped

\* Some rational understanding. Little intuitive understanding

**Level 3:** Struggling to break out of 3-3/4-2 and then drop

\* Missing a few fundamental skills

\* Plateau (of some duration) likely

\* More rational understanding than before. Little intuitive understanding

**Level 4:** Consistently breaking, bid if lucky

\* Missing a few key realizations

\* Good rational understanding, intuitive understanding in progress. Diminishing marginal returns on improving rational understanding

**Level 5:** Usually bid  
\* Understands the activity well

\* Excellent rational understanding. Good intuitive understanding

**Level 6:** Late elims/finals

\* Understands the activity extraordinarily well

\* Great intuition. Diminishing marginal returns on general improvement
