#### Policy (DA/disad):

\* Uniqueness: a description of the status quo. It can be on the “right” or the “wrong” side of the link. For example, say uniqueness claims we are in a recession, and the link says the plan causes an economic collapse. There is already a recession, so the bad impacts of economic collapse are inevitable, regardless of the plan. This argument is “nonunique.”

\* Link: an argument that something does something bad. For example, that a carbon tax will cause a recession.

\* Internal link: A link predicated on another link. For example, say the NEG’s link argument says that banning GMOs would lead to higher food prices. An internal link might say that higher food prices might lead to US-Russia tensions. 

\* Impact: the bad thing at the end of a link (chain). For example, if the link said the plan would cause a recession, the impact would talk about why the recession was bad. 

\* Link uniqueness:   

\* Impact uniqueness 

\* Thumper
